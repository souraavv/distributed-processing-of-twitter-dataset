94763,136586,True,Thu Nov 30 15:28:33 +0000 2017,@AppleSupport there is a slight green tint on the top right of my iPhone X screen. It shows up in the passcode screen and Spotify but there could be more places I didn’t notice yet. Is this suppose to be there? I have the all black wallpaper on. https://t.co/NTkeFOLFrU,94762,
